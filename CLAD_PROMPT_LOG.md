# ShotSpace CLAD Prompt Log

## Project Goal

ShotSpace is a spatial previsualization tool for blocking actors,
testing focal lengths and framing, previewing lens distortion,
and planning shots.

## Prompt 0 — Project Preflight

Date: 2026-09-06

Prompt:

> Using the Lens Studio router and /specs-project-init, inspect the
> currently open ShotSpace Lens Studio project and validate that it is
> ready for a SPECS 27 CLAD build.
>
> Confirm:
>
> 1. The Lens Studio MCP connection is active.
> 2. The project targets SPECS.
> 3. The Preview panel targets SPECS 27.
> 4. The main camera has Device Tracking set to World.
> 5. SPECS UI Kit is installed.
> 6. Spectacles Interaction Kit is installed.
> 7. The SpectaclesInteractionKit prefab is present exactly once.
> 8. The project compiles without red Logger errors.
>
> Make only the minimum changes required to initialize the project.
> Do not replace the base scene, create the ShotSpace experience, generate
> 3D assets, or add lens controls yet.
>
> After checking the project, run /verify-preview and report:
>
> - What was already configured correctly
> - What you changed
> - Any remaining warnings or errors
> - Whether the project is ready for scene construction

Result: Found `ShotSpace.esproj` and the existing base scene assets. No Lens project or scene changes were made because live Lens Studio access could not be established.

Problems: The Lens Studio MCP namespace and required tools were not registered in the current Cursor session. Project target, Preview configuration, camera tracking, installed packages, prefab count, compilation, and Logger output could not be validated. `/verify-preview` could not run.

Changes requested: Open `ShotSpace.esproj` in Lens Studio 5.22 or newer, ensure the Lens Studio MCP integration is enabled, then fully restart the Cursor session from this project and repeat this preflight prompt.

Correction prompt:

> Open ShotSpace.esproj in Lens Studio 5.22+, enable MCP integration, then fully restart Cursor from this project and repeat the prompt.

Correction result: `ShotSpace.esproj` was launched successfully using its Windows file association. Enabling MCP and restarting Cursor remain manual UI actions; the preflight must be repeated in the restarted session.

Retry result: After Cursor restarted, the Lens Studio MCP connection was active and authorized. Lens Studio 5.23.2 had the correct `ShotSpace.esproj` open. The project already targeted SPECS; Preview was set to SPECS 27 with the Sunlit Room interactive source; the main Perspective camera had Device Tracking set to World; SPECS UI Kit and Spectacles Interaction Kit were installed; and exactly one `SpectaclesInteractionKit` prefab was present at the scene root. TypeScript compilation succeeded, runtime Logger collection returned no warnings or errors, and `/verify-preview` captured a valid SPECS 27 stereo preview.

Retry problems: None.

Retry changes: No Lens scene, package, camera, preview, or project-setting changes were required. Only this prompt log was updated.

Ready for scene construction: Yes.

## Logging Instructions

After each major prompt:

- Copy the prompt.
- Record what CLAD successfully created.
- Note errors or unexpected behavior.
- Copy important correction prompts.

The prompt log should show iteration, not only the final successful prompt.
